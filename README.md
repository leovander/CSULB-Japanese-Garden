CECS470 Japanese Garden
============================
This project was assigned to us by [Dr. Alvaro Monge](http://www.csulb.edu/~amonge/) for
the Spring 2014 [CECS 470: Web Programming and Accessibility](http://www.csulb.edu/~amonge/classes/470/2014spring/) Course.

We were tasked with recreating the [Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden](http://www.csulb.edu/~jgarden/) website,
by using the [HTML5 Specifications](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/), [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), and the [Section 508 Rehabilitation Act of 1973](http://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards).

On top of the above, we also had to make sure to not write inline JavaScript and CSS.
