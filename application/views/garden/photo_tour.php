					to maintain these natural artworks, for bonsai and the larger artistic pruned trees in the Garden. 
					Historically inspired lanterns line the courtyard, and the large wooden gate is modeled after those

				</figure>
				<p>Traditionally, gardens in Japan were designed to be viewed, and appreciated from inside a room, looking out. 
					With that notion in mind, our garden designer Ed Lovell, ASLA, carefully placed six stone benches along the pathway to provide 
					seated areas for visitors to view the garden’s different “rooms.” The first bench comes just passed the docent cart. It has a large, 
					but manicured black pine forest behind it, stretching, and twisting towards the sky. Hidden among the trees is a three-tiered pagoda. 
					And, in the winter, large magnolia blossoms bring color to the room. In front of the bench, the view stretches out over the pond. 
					A red maple shades the wooden zig-zag bridge and waterfall across the pond. This sunny, warm area is a great place to sit and watch 
					people feed the Koi, talk on the moon-viewing platform, or walk through the Garden.</p>

					<p>The moon-viewing platform is another fun location for feeding the Koi, and a picturesque spot to snap

						and Ed Lovall, and include George Tabor, Formosa, Alaskan and Carnival Queen. These azaleas produce the boldest splash of color 
						to be found in the garden. Japanese gardens are designed to showcase the greenery of shrubs and trees and are generally more 
						monochromatic than Western-style gardens, which emphasize the colors of blooming plants. The dominance of greenery creates a 
						serene and restive quality in the garden, but southern Californian influence can be seen in the many blooming flowers throughout

					<p>The George Yamaguchi tree, named for the extraordinarily talented man who trained and later sold the tree to 
						the Garden, is our most valued of all the artistic black pines in the Garden. Standing between the black rock beach and the moon 
						bridge and next to the meandering path, the Yamaguchi tree has value because of its form, age, and pedigree training by a decorated 
						Japanese-American artist in the field of bonsai— a Japanese cultural art form. Yamaguchi won ten consecutive blue ribbons from the 
						LA county fair, and had the George Yamaguchi North American Garden at the US arboretum in Washington D.C. dedicated to him in 1993. 
						He had been training the tree for 25 years at his West Los Angeles Bonsai Nursery at the time of the sale in the early 1980’s.

					<p>Both Japanese iris along the water’s edge, and water lilies in the pond bloom brilliantly in spring, providing

				<p>The dry garden or the karesansui is a raked gravel garden representing a body of water. The raked designs express 
					the "state of the sea" and this particular design represents "tranquility". There are an odd number of nine rocks each representing 
					an island in the sea. The green islands are covered with Korean Grass and there is a well-shaped Japanese black pine on the large 
					island on the right. The fence was made from bamboo grown in the garden. Student assistants rake the gravel daily, and take that time 
					to contemplate life, love, and finals.</p>

				<p>Generally, zig-zag bridges in Japanese gardens are inspired by the bridges of the Mikiwa Province of Japan in 
					the 10th century that zig-zagged across eight channels branching from a single river. In our garden, the bridge’s objective is 
					to force the walker to be attentive and mindful of the current place and time – being here in the now. This bridge requires us 
					to slow down and to be excited, and appreciative of what we find at every turn. It curves sharply at two ninety degree angled 
					turns and leads us past the waterfall and into the last area of the Garden. The bridge’s turns force us to look at different 
					parts of the garden as we walk across it. First, we look in at the waterfall, and the maples and pines that cascade over it. 
					Then we look outward at the pond, the Garden, and what is going on all around. Lastly, we are forced to turn back towards the 
					path, and look at what is left of the journey ahead.</p>

					<p>The zig-zag bride, half-moon bridge, and moon viewing platform were all rebuilt from 2010-2012 from Brazilian 
						Ironwood. It is the strongest, and densest wood on the planet making it impervious to almost all pests, and able to withstand 
						the harshest weather conditions for a hundred years. Built by Facilities Management here on campus, these bridges have been 
						masterfully crafted to not show any joints, or fasteners; it was a pain staking process to keep them simple and aesthetically 
						pleasing. We hope these upgraded features will stand strong and support many generations of southern Californians as they walk 
						through, and appreciate our gardens.</p>

					<p>To the right of the waterfall, a rankei lantern, which is also called spring lantern, unique to the 19th century 
						stands next to the water beneath the pine. This lantern is placed at the water’s edge, so its arched supporting column extends 
						over the water, and creates a reflected image in the water. All of our stone lanterns have been hand crafted in Japan, and flown here.</p>
