        <h2>A place for learning, cultural exchange and contemplation for all</h2>
        <p>
            Each year over 5,000 school children enjoy booking a tour/field trip to the garden or participate in special
            programs arranged by the garden’s Education Department. In addition, through the support of the Friends of
            the Japanese Garden the garden offers a calendar of public education events. In 2000 an Educational Outreach
            Committee was formed to support the educational experience at the Japanese Garden and the utilization of the
            garden’s aesthetic and cultural resources. Committee members include CSULB faculty and teachers from the
            Long Beach Unified School District.
